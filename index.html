            <strong>Cricketcup-blogspot</strong> <em>     April 19, 2021</em>
            <article>
            <p>Casio’s iconic G-Shock range of watches known for their legendary toughness, trailblazing designs and innovative technology has tied up with IPL 2021’s youngest and the most exciting team Rajasthan Royals to become their official toughness partner. </p> 
            <p>The tie-up kickstarts G-Shock’s formal association with competitive sports in India. The wide range of watches are meant for raising the bar on the field due to their superior toughness, light materials, and fitness-related functions.</p> 
            <p>The partnership provides a unique chance to tap into the individual fan bases of the team and the G-Shock community in India to collaborate and drive the visibility for the respective brands. This also opens up a new area of collaboration in the future where custom-designed limited-edition G-Shocks for Rajasthan Royals can be a part of official player equipment and fan merchandise.</p> 
            <p><strong>Commenting on this partnership, Casio India’s Vice President Mr Kulbhushan Seth said,</strong><q>G-Shock is an iconic watch brand across the world by being integral to the youth culture through fashion, music, arts and sports. G-Shock is designed to be tough & raises the bar on-field performance.  Rajasthan Royals is a resilient & tough team and this partnership opens up a unique opportunity for both brands to further inspire and drive the never give up attitude amongst a larger section of youth who actively follow cricket and are G-shock lovers.</q></p>
